# ETF Analyzer and Web Application

This application was created to further analyze and draw conclusions from a financial database using SQL, Pandas and hvplot. Voila was then also used to create a more robust application by allowing the analysis to become a web application.

---

## Technologies 

This application runs on Python 3.7. 

---

## Libraries

This analysis used extensive plotting with the hvplot library. Import statements already present in program, refer to them below:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
import sqlalchemy
```

## Database

This program couldn't run without the ETF database:

* etf.db
